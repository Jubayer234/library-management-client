      Books are our best friends. When we are lonely or unhappy a book can cheer us up. It can change our view of and give meaning to life. Books are a treasure house of knowledge. Through words and pictures books can take us anywhere in the universe. We can learn about the world of matter and spirit in reality and through the imagination of the author.

We read many different books. There are books that belong to the categories of fiction and non-fiction. There are books that we study in school. These are text books. We study them to acquire knowledge on the various subjects like science, mathematics, geography and history, besides others. There are also reference and academic books on the various subjects that are scholastic in nature.

There are books that we read for pleasure and entertainment too or for the enrichment of our lives. There are books on travels, adventure, history, spirituality, nature and health that are non-fiction.

We also read works of fiction. The stories may belong to many different genres like comedy, romance, horror, fantasy, thriller and detective. Literary works in fiction could be in the form of prose or drama or poetry.

Books are published in many different languages. Books are easy to carry around, and so they can be read anywhere and at any time. Books are also available for reading on the internet.

I enjoy reading the abridged versions of the plays of Shakespeare. I have read Merchant of Venice, and As You Like it, a nice comedy. I also enjoy reading poetry by old British poets like Oliver Goldsmith, Robert Browning and William Wordsworth. I especially like to read the poem Pied Piper of Hamelin by Robert Browning. It is actually a poem that Browning wrote for his friendâ€™s little son.
